CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION
        The global construction industry is undergoing a technological revolution, driven by the increasing demand for efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in project management. With the rise of Industry 4.0, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Internet of Things (IoT) integration, construction firms around the world are adopting digital systems to streamline workflows, enhance real-time collaboration, and reduce project delays and cost overruns (Zhao et al., 2021). These innovations are fundamentally reshaping how construction activities are monitored and controlled, allowing companies to gain a competitive edge through improved project delivery, enhanced stakeholder communication, and data-driven decision making. The digital transformation has proven particularly effective in addressing traditional construction challenges such as budget overruns, schedule delays, and quality control issues that have historically plagued the industry.
       In the ASEAN region, construction sectors in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand are also embracing digital transformation to address inefficiencies in traditional construction practices. Government-led initiatives like Singapore's Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Construction Industry Transformation Map encourage the use of integrated digital delivery systems to improve project lifecycle management and promote sustainable construction practices. However, significant disparities still exist across member countries, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where the adoption of modern monitoring systems remains slow due to high implementation costs, lack of technical expertise, and organizational resistance to change (ASEAN Development Outlook, 2023). This uneven adoption creates a technological divide that affects competitiveness and project outcomes across the region, with more advanced economies leading the digital transformation while developing markets struggle to keep pace.
          In the Philippines, the construction industry serves as a major contributor to national economic growth, generating substantial employment and supporting infrastructure development initiatives. Yet many firms continue to operate using manual, paper-based monitoring systems that limit their operational efficiency and growth potential. While large construction companies have begun adopting digital solutions and investing in modern project management technologies, a significant number of SMEs still rely on spreadsheets and physical logs for tracking project activities, material inventory, and workforce deployment. This outdated approach results in limited project visibility, poor resource allocation, delayed responses to emerging on-site issues, and difficulties in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2022). The gap between current practices and available technologies highlights the urgent need for practical, scalable digital solutions specifically tailored to the Philippine construction context and the unique challenges faced by local SMEs.
          Sunshine Sapphire Construction and Supply, Inc., a growing SME in the Philippines, exemplifies the operational challenges commonly faced by local construction companies. At present, their construction development monitoring heavily depends on manual record-keeping using Excel spreadsheets. This approach makes it extremely difficult to manage multiple ongoing projects efficiently, ensure timely procurement and delivery of materials, and track workforce productivity across different job sites. The lack of real-time data, automation, and centralized tracking leads to frequent project delays, increased operational costs, and difficulties in maintaining quality and compliance. These challenges are further compounded by communication breakdowns among staff, delayed reporting, and poor coordination between project teams—factors that negatively affect overall project performance and client satisfaction.
          The absence of an integrated monitoring system reveals a critical gap between outdated manual methods and the potential benefits of adopting a digital construction management platform. To address this, the proposed Supply and Construction Development Monitoring System aims to replace fragmented, Excel-based processes with a centralized, automated system that provides real-time data access, automated reporting, comprehensive inventory tracking, and systematic task management. Unlike the current setup that is manual, reactive, and error-prone, the proposed system is proactive, data-driven, and designed to enable better decision-making through real-time insights, instant alerts, and predictive analytics. This transition marks a strategic shift from traditional, reactive approaches to proactive project management and digital efficiency.
          This study is grounded in the goal of enhancing operational efficiency and promoting digital transformation among SMEs in the Philippine construction industry. By developing a customized monitoring system for Sunshine Sapphire Construction and Supply, Inc., the study not only addresses the company’s internal operational inefficiencies but also contributes to a broader understanding of how digital tools can transform project management practices in similar contexts. The successful implementation of the system is expected to boost productivity, minimize delays, strengthen quality control, and support the company’s long-term growth and competitiveness in an increasingly digital construction environment. Additionally, the research findings aim to provide valuable insights for other SMEs seeking to modernize their operations and embrace digital solutions in the Philippine construction sector.
Background of the Study
          The construction industry plays a vital role in economic development, contributing significantly to infrastructure growth and employment generation. Globally, the sector accounts for around 13% of GDP, and it is expected to reach a market value of USD 14 trillion by 2025 (McKinsey & Company, 2020). In the Philippines, construction companies face numerous challenges in managing projects efficiently, particularly in monitoring supply chains and development progress. These challenges are amplified by the increasing complexity of modern construction projects and the need for real-time data to support critical decision-making processes (Asian Development Bank, 2022).
          Sunshine Sapphire Construction and Supply, Inc., a domestic corporation registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 14, 2019, exemplifies the challenges faced by growing construction companies in the Philippines. Located at St. Mark Ave. Dona Juliana Subd., Brgy. Taculing, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, the company has been operating for six years with a workforce of 12 employees. The company specializes in both private and government construction projects, including building construction and road development, serving diverse clients such as private companies, individuals, Local Government Units (LGUs), and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).
          The company's organizational structure is led by an Authorized Managing Officer/Project Manager, supported by a technical staff comprising two Licensed Civil Engineers, one Professional Electrical Engineer, and one Professional Mechanical Engineer. Additionally, four accounting and administrative staff members maintain office operations, while the corporation maintains a workforce of skilled and non-skilled workers to support project execution.
          Despite its established presence in the construction industry, Sunshine Sapphire Construction and Supply, Inc. currently relies on Microsoft Excel for project management and monitoring activities. This traditional approach presents significant limitations, including difficulties in data management, lack of real-time information access, and absence of automated processes. The company's leadership recognizes that these limitations hinder operational efficiency and compromise their ability to make timely, informed decisions during critical project phases (Oesterreich & Teuteberg, 2016).
          The company's core services include providing accurate cost estimation for construction projects and offering design services in both civil and structural engineering. Their primary goal is to engage in general construction services while maintaining high standards of quality and safety. However, the current monitoring system limitations create challenges in achieving these objectives effectively.
          Key performance indicators currently tracked by the company include on-time project completion rates and resource utilization. The company ensures quality and safety standards through partnerships with trusted suppliers, regular safety meetings and toolbox meetings, routine inspections, and maintaining the presence of Construction Safety Officers and First Aiders on project sites. Communication and coordination among project teams and stakeholders are currently managed through weekly meetings, email, and SMS/calls.

          Improvements in the current project monitoring system are necessary to address growing inefficiencies and meet the increasing complexity of construction projects. Relying solely on manual spreadsheets limits the company's ability to make real-time, data-driven decisions, leading to delays in project completion and difficulty in identifying risks early. These inefficiencies can result in time wastage, miscommunication among team members, and cost overruns—consequences that could compromise the company’s reputation, client trust, and profitability. As the construction landscape becomes more competitive, these operational weaknesses could hinder Sunshine Sapphire’s ability to grow and win larger government and private contracts (World Bank, 2023).
          To address these challenges, a Supply and Construction Development Monitoring System is proposed as a tailored digital solution for Sunshine Sapphire Construction and Supply, Inc. This computerized system is designed to automate project tracking, manage supply chains efficiently, and provide real-time access to project data. By integrating modules for progress monitoring, material inventory, reporting, and team coordination, the system enhances decision-making and reduces the likelihood of delays or miscommunication. It aims to transform the current manual process into a streamlined, efficient, and data-driven approach, ultimately improving productivity, transparency, and project success rates.

CHAPTER III

DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
      
          This chapter discusses the research approach and development methodology used in creating the Supply and Construction Development Monitoring System. It also presents the system design, specifications, and development process.
      
Research Approach
       In analyzing and designing the system, the proponents employed the Agile Software Development Method, which uses iterative cycles called sprints to deliver and refine functional features. This method emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement, making it suitable for gradually integrating system functions and ensuring early delivery of essential features.
System Development Method
Figure 1. Agile Model
      The agile methodology will be implemented through the following phase:
Requirements
         In Agile, requirements are not gathered all at once but are continuously identified and refined throughout development. Instead of rigid documentation, requirements are broken down into user stories or backlog items that describe what the system should achieve from the user’s perspective. This makes the process flexible and ensures that the system always aligns with the users’ current needs.
Design
          The design phase in Agile is not fixed at the beginning but evolves with the project. The system is structured in a way that allows modifications as new requirements emerge. Agile design emphasizes simplicity and adaptability, ensuring that future changes or new features can be integrated without disrupting the entire system.
Development
          Development in Agile is carried out in short, time-boxed cycles called sprints. Each sprint delivers a set of working features that can be tested and used immediately. This incremental approach ensures that progress is visible and functional software is consistently delivered, reducing risks of delays or failures at the end of the project.
Testing
          Testing is integrated into every sprint, ensuring that issues are identified and corrected early rather than waiting until the end of development. This continuous testing approach maintains system quality, prevents accumulation of bugs, and guarantees that each new feature works correctly with the existing functions.
Deployment
          In Agile, deployment happens frequently and incrementally. Instead of waiting for the entire system to be finished, completed features are deployed in stages. This allows users to start benefiting from the system early, while developers continue adding improvements and new functionalities in future sprints.
Review
          The review stage takes place at the end of each sprint. Developers, along with users, evaluate the work completed, provide feedback, and identify what can be improved. This process ensures that the system remains aligned with user expectations and that future sprints are more efficient and better focused.



Operational Framework
Figure 2 presents the framework of the study. It covers the input, process, output and outcomes of the study. 

In the input phase, the proponents conducted an interview with the owner of the selected company and observed how the manual inventory system with monitoring development is currently operated. In the process phase, proponents gather all requirements needed, design using sketch, prototyping and developing the system using programming software like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and other programming languages needed for the development of the system. In the output phase, as the result of previous phases proponents already have the actual system together with the designs and functions that are working.

System Analysis
Data Analysis
                The proposed Supply Monitoring with Construction Development Monitoring is highly data-driven, relying on structured entities and well-defined relationships to ensure the integrity and consistency of information across modules. The analysis of system data centers on identifying the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships that interconnect them.

Entity Identification:
Users – stores user account details, login credentials, and role assignments 
(Admin, 1 Super admin).
Projects – contains essential project information such as project title, location, number of units, duration, and status.
Materials – manages the global inventory of construction materials, including material name, category, quantity, unit, and acquisition date.
Construction Reports – records daily progress reports for each project, containing report date, status, remarks, proof images, and used materials during the creation of the progress.
Report Material Usage – a junction entity that connects daily reports with the materials used, including quantities consumed and deduction status.
Project Checklists – manages project milestones and task completion indicators for progress monitoring.

Process Analysis
         The process analysis defines how data flows across modules and how the system supports user interactions. It emphasizes the workflows required to complete major tasks, ensuring the system meets functional requirements.
Application Architecture
 Figure 3 shows the Application Architecture of the system which shows the system's functionality in terms of the different users. The diagram also shows that the system will be hosted online for dynamic access of the users.

Entity Relationship Diagram
Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the study. ERD is a diagram that depicts the relationship between entity sets in a database. In other words, ER diagrams aid in explaining logical database structure. Entities, attributes, and relationships are the three main elements built by ER diagrams
